# Vision_Bilgegöz / Smart Wristwatch for Visually Impaired
This is the project called Vision-Bilgegöz, which is a smart wristwatch for visually impaired that uses object detection, OCR and text to speech (TTS) for helping blind people.

# Problem & Purpose
The fact that visually impaired are having difficulties in understanding their environment, and the price/uselessness of present visually impaired systems is a huge problem today. The purpose of this project is developing a wristwatch sized, low-cost device that tells the objects and the text it has detected with the camera from the headphones in order to make the life of visually disabled easier.

# Innovative Aspects
-Being the first system that can do object detection and text recognition at the same time.

-Being the first device that detects the distance and the direction of the objects in addition to their definitions.

-Being the first device in the shape of a wristwatch which helps visually disabled by giving them services like object detection and text reading.

-Supporting hand coordination as being in the form of a wristwatch.

-Not requiring any training or familiarization process, thanks to its capability of talking.

-Having software that can maintain an information flow in a lot more advanced level with the machine learning techniques to the visually disabled.

-Doing object detection using a model developed with Google’s rich machine learning platform Tensorflow and thus reaching accuracy rates up to 97%.

-Ability to read texts with high accuracy in many different conditions using the Tesseract OCR software developed by Google.

-Functioning in 4 different languages: Turkish, English, French, and German. And this can be increased.

-Being the first blind assistive system under 100 TL. (~17$ June 2019)

-Being made with easy production methods such as 3D printing.

-Contributing to recycling as having an old cell phone battery.

-Being able to reach everybody, including people with low socioeconomic levels, thanks to its low cost and easy production.

-Being a cheap and capable system thanks to having a high-level software and being made with low-cost electronic components.

# Library

For this project, the Tensorflow library was used by modifying the android example of tensorflow library.
